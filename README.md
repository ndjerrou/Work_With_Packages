# Node's standard modules

With nodejs compared to native JS, we can interact with the file system, which is great !

Discover the fs core module of node and learn how to read/write files efficiently.

We need to a closer look to the async/sync methods for an optimal use of the resources for the purpose of the application

We finally moove to a popular paackage yarn which allows us to build faster CLI tool.

Have fun !
